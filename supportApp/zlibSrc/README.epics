This directory contains the zlib code (1.2.8).  
It has been slightly modified to build under the EPICS build system.

It is intended for use on WIN32, vxWorks, and RTEMS.  
On Linux and OS-X the standard package managers should be used instead.

No source files needed to be modified.

zconf.h was generated by running ./configure in the distribution on a 64-bit Linux system (Fedora 15).
  This was modified to undefine HAVE_UNISTD_H on Visual Studio.

Makefile  
  This is completely new.
